    <p> The <b>Silkie</b> (also known as the Silky or Chinese silk chicken) is a breed of chicken named for its
      atypically fluffy plumage, which is said to feel like silk and satin. The breed has several other unusual
      qualities, such as black skin and bones, blue earlobes, and five toes on each foot, whereas most chickens have
      only four. They are often exhibited in poultry shows, and also appear in various colors. In addition to their
      distinctive physical characteristics, Silkies are well known for their calm and friendly temperament. It is among
      the most docile of poultry. Hens are also exceptionally broody, and care for young well. Although they are fair
      layers themselves, laying only about three eggs a week, they are commonly used to hatch eggs from other breeds and
      bird species due to their broody nature. Silkie chickens have been bred to have a wide variety of colors which
      include but arre not limited to: Black, Blue, Buff, Partridge, Splash, White, Lavender, Paint and Porcelain.</p>
